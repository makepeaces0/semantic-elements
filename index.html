    <p><strong>Elements With Meaning: A Summary of Semantic Elements</strong></p>
    <p>Semantic elements are terms used to make the grouping of pages more clearly and universally understood by both the developer and browser. Semantics provide the meaning behind the tags being used instead of having terms that are exclusively understood by the developer. This leads to accessibility, searchability, internationalization, and interoperability according to Michelle in An Overview of HTML5 Semantics (2016). Tags that represent the look of the site are not included in semantics because they arenâ€™t attributed to meaning.</p>
    <p>Use semantic tags to enhance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Accessibility</em> to technologies</li>
      <li><em>Searchability</em> by computers</li>
      <li><em>Internationalization</em> so the world can read it</li>
      <li><em>Interoperability</em> to create readable structure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Semantic Elements create a universal understanding</p>

      <h4>Example of A Semantic Element:</h4>
        <p>Adding a New Paragraph:</p>
          <p>Instead of calling the new paragraph something completely unrelated to the actual word, the simple way to right the tag is using the letter "p" for "paragraph" written as &lt;p&gt;</p>

      <h4>More Than Looks</h4>
        <p>What about tags that represent how the content appears on the site itself?</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p> <i>On the flip side of this equation, tags like &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; are not semantic, because they define only how the text should look (bold or italic) and do not provide any additional meaning to the markup.</i></p>
